    <h1>My favorite activities include speedcubing, chess, CADing, martial arts, and coding.</h1>
    <h2>Speedubing</h2>
    <p>Speedubing is where you solve Rubik's cube puzzles as fast as possible</p>
    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <p>Chess is a strategy board game that requires critical thinking, problem solving, and strategic planning to win.</p>
    <h2 class="FRC">CADing/robotics</h2>
    <section class="infoBox">
        <p>I like to CAD and work in robotics. CAD is computer aided design where you design parts or something on a computer. I find this fun because there are many ways to design various objects. </p>
        <p>I like to work in robotics because there are various subteams to work in, I like to use my skills in technology and engineering, and I enjoy helping with making a robot work.</p>
        <p>This way, you can use the design to fabricate it into a tangable part. In robotics, the CAD team designs the robot parts. Then fabrication uses those design to fabricate the parts. Assembly </p>
